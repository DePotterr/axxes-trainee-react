# Exercise 10

## TODO

Add functionality to create a meeting

## Requirements

- create a `NewMeeting` page component
- use react hook form (https://react-hook-form.com/get-started)
- make `NewMeeting` available on `/meetings/new` route
- use the create meeting button to navigate
- use an axios POST to `http://localhost:3002/meetings` to submit the form (https://axios-http.com/docs/post_example)

## Tip

Keep thinking in React: a component should only have one responsibility
