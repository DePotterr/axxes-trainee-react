# Exercise 2

TODO: Make sure our navigation drawer can be shown/hidden

Requirements:

- use the appropriate event handlers from AppBar and Drawer (hint: console errors for prop types)
- use state

TIP:
It's common to prefix your events with `on` and your event handlers with `handle`

For example:

`onClick={handleClick}`
