# Exercise 8

## TODO

Add routing to our project

## Requirements

Add the following routes:

- /meetings (MeetingOverview component)
- / should redirect to /meetings
- Unknown routes should show the NotFound component

## Useful Links

- react-router-dom documentation: https://reactrouter.com/en/main/getting-started/overview

## Extension

- Define your routes in an array configuration in `shared/routes/index.js`
- Go over the array in your `App.jsx`
